/** Throttle
 * Returns a function with a built in throttle timer that runs after `delay` ms.
 * Original from "@automerge/automerge-repo/src/helpers/throttle.js";
 *
 * This function differs from a conventional `throttle` in that it ensures the final
 * call will also execute and delays sending the first one until `delay` ms to allow
 * additional work to accumulate.
 *
 * Here's a diagram:
 *
 * calls +----++++++-----++----
 * dlay  ^--v ^--v^--v   ^--v
 * execs ---+----+---+------+--
 *
 * The goal in this design is to create batches of changes without flooding
 * communication or storage systems while still feeling responsive.
 * (By default we communicate at 10hz / every 100ms.)
 *
 * Note that the args go inside the parameter and you should be careful not to
 * recreate the function on each usage. (In React, see useMemo().)
 *
 *
 * Example usage:
 * const callback = debounce((ev) => { doSomethingExpensiveOrOccasional() }, 100)
 * target.addEventListener('frequent-event', callback);
 *
