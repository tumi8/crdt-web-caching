Our measurement data is published over [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13982759).
The dataset consists of 8 individual experiments and contains the log messages of clients, proxies, and the origin.

You can directly download it:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/13982760/files/data.zip
unzip data.zip
```

The jupyter notebook used for our analyses is available [[here]](https://github.com/tumi8/crdt-web-caching/blob/main/analysis_notebook.ipynb)
